### Description
This paper describes a novel implementation for phishing detection on the internet. For this project,
we will implement the phishing detection model and then we will compare our results with the
results of the original authors from their experiment.

### Dataset

After some research online, we found a github repo that contained a list of active phishing sites updated hourly.
This list of phishing sites will be used to determine the effectiveness of the detection algorithm we are attempting to replicate.

## Goals
For this project, we will be replicating the phishing detection model developed by the author's of the paper. To do this, we will implement the model in Python3. The model as well as the phishing detection algorithm can be seen below.

### Phishing Detection Model
This is taken directly from the author's of the paper linked above:

### Algorithm
This is the phishing detection algoirthm for a webpage developed by the authors:
